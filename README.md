# Prestashop performance project

This project aims to provide tools to benchmark Prestashop.

Thos very same tools were developped and used during our own performance benchmark here at PrestaShop.

There are 2 main components you will find here:

* A dockerised gatling, used to run the test scenario
* A custom shop with some products already installed, also to run with docker

## Run pre-populated shop

Go into `/shop` directory, and follow the README.md instructions

## Run Gating scenarios

Go into `/benchmark/gatling` directory, and follow the README.md instructions
